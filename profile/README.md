# Yolo Services

Welcome to **Yolo Services** – a small but ambitious team building modern tools, apps, and services.  
We’re developers, creators, and tech enthusiasts who enjoy turning ideas into real, useful products.

## 🚀 What we do

We work on a variety of projects, mostly focused on:

- 🛠️ Web and mobile applications  
- 🤖 Bots and automations (e.g. Discord bots)  
- 🛍️ SaaS products and internal tools

We care about clean design, smooth user experience, and learning by doing.

## 🧩 Current projects

- [**Sitezy**](https://github.com/yolo-services/sitezy-next) – a powerful website & store builder.
- [**frozi.lol**](https://github.com/yolo-services/frozi-lol) – a platform that provides modern and feature-rich bio links.
- [**whimz**](https://github.com/yolo-services/whimz-app-web) – minimalistic end-to-end encrypted chat web app (in development)
- [**YoloBot**](https://github.com/yolo-services/yolobot) – a modular Discord bot with useful commands and utilities.
- **Dripzy** – a social mobile app for fashion lovers (coming soon)

We like to keep things simple and useful – if it solves a problem or helps someone out, we’re in.
